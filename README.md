# Slay the Spire Map Building

The last two months I played this game a lot . 

Slay the Spire is a strategy games fused with card and roguelikes together. Its map is generated randomly and this feature interested me so much. I want to implement it again.  Firstly I will implement the map structure , then I will find a method to traverse this map . At last I will use a topo library to visualize it.

And I want to force myself to use Object-oriented coding style this time .

There are some features to be completed soon :
+ the coordinate of each node should be random in a certain range.
+ the random function that determine the node's type should be a function with level variable;
+ the middle of the levels should be chest node;
+ the last but one level should only contain bonfire nodes.
+ the split probability shold be corrected.
